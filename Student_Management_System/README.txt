# Student Management System

## Overview

The Student Management System is an ASP.NET MVC application designed to manage student records. The application provides functionalities to create, read, update, and delete student entries. It uses Entity Framework for data access and Bootstrap for responsive styling.

## Approach

### Architecture

- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: The project follows the MVC pattern to separate concerns.
- **Entity Framework**: Used for data access, providing an ORM for the database.
- **Bootstrap**: Used for responsive design and styling of forms and layouts.

### Features

- **Index**: Lists all students.
- **Details**: Shows detailed information for a single student.
- **Create**: Allows adding new student records.
- **Edit**: Allows modifying existing student records.
- **Delete**: Allows removing student records.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET Framework 4.8.0 or later
- Visual Studio 2022 or later
- SQL Server or SQL Server Express

### Installation

1. **Open the Project**

   Open the solution file `Student_Management_System.sln` in Visual Studio.

2. **Restore NuGet Packages**

   In Visual Studio, right-click on the solution and select "Restore NuGet Packages" to ensure all dependencies are installed.

3. **Update the Database**

   Use Entity Framework Migrations to update the database schema. Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio and run:

4. **Run the Application**

   Press `F5` or click on "Start Debugging" in Visual Studio to build and run the application. It should open in your default web browser.

### Configuration

- **Database Connection**: The connection string is defined in the `Web.config` file under the `<connectionStrings>` section. Update it to match your local database settings.

   ```xml
   <connectionStrings>
       <add name="StudentDbContext" connectionString="Server=(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=StudentDb;Trusted_Connection=True;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
   </connectionStrings>
   ```
